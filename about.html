           <p>An old school computer geek, for better or for worse. Dave wrote his first bit of code back when the Apple ][e was the new hotness, yet has never considered himself a coder until now. Between then and now, Dave's worked as a *nix admin and an academic/medical librarian.</p>
           <p>When not working, Dave engages in sailing, kayaking, and naval gazing. Hell&hellip; He's been known to do those while working.</p>
