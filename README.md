Trivia Crossroads
=================

A meeting place for Trivia enthusiasts to find events and other likeminded people in Seattle.

This is a final project for Code Fellows 201d1.

The name *Trivia Crossroads* is based on the etymology of the word trivia, specifically: The word **trivia** comes from the Latin word **trivium**, meaning a meeting of three roads.

About the site
--------------
Trivia Crossroads is a website where one can go to find members for a Pub Trivia team. Additionally, the site lists local Pub Trivia events.

When one enters their information (contact info, trivia specialty, and availability), their
 details are stored in The Cloud™. They are then available for those needing a team member.

Users looking for team members can filter the list by availability (neighborhood or day) *-or-* specialty.

Since user profiles are stored in the cloud, the data persists across time and space. :boom:
