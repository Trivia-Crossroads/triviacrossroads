Trivia Crossroads is a website where one can go to find members for a Pub Trivia team. Additionally, the site lists local Pub Trivia events.

When one enters their information (contact info, trivia specialty, and availability), their details are store in The Cloud. They are then available for those needing a team member.

Users looking for team members can filter the list by availability (neighborhood or day) *-or-* specialty.

Since user profiles are stored in the cloud, the data persists across time and space. :boom:

The name *Trivia Crossroads* is based on the etymology of the word trivia, specifically: The word **trivia** comes from the Latin word **trivium**, meaning a meeting of three roads.
